## How i thought about the project and its functioning

**_Main Idea : Simple ToDo List_**

My idea was simple , I wanted a To-Do list app that when user will write anything to do ; the app shows  all stuff´s user into a little To-Do cards

First of all , I made a "to-do generator" that is a box that if the user writes into it and clicks button "generate ToDo" ,the content into the box will storage into the main state of the app, the  "List"

With the stuff contained into the "List" state , will be render "To-Do Card/s".Each has two buttons , one is delete and the other is edit .

If user clicks delete , the "To-Do Card" will be delete. If the user clicks edit , the "To-Do Card" will be availaible for edit the content and change or not the task

For the styles i use SASS, because i feel so confortable and for me it´s very eficient this tool
